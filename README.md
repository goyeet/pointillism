**Description:** A p5.js program that converts images into pointillism art.

*"Pointillism is a technique of painting in which small, distinct dots of color are applied in patterns to form an image."*

My artistic intent for this project was to create a pointillism art converter and it seems to work how I intended.
While quite simple, the results replicate the pointillism art style well so I'm pleased with the way it turned out!
